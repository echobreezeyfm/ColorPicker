## üöÄ Quick Start

Integrating EBECP into your project is a simple three-step process.

### Step 1: Link the Files

In the `<head>` of your HTML document, link to the CSS and JS files.

```html
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/ebecp-color-picker.css">
    <script src="path/to/ebecp-color-picker.js"></script>
</head>
```

### Step 2: Paste the HTML Structure

Copy the entire content of `ebecp-color-picker.html` and paste it just before the closing `</body>` tag of your main HTML file.

### Step 3: Call it with JavaScript

Now you can easily invoke the color picker from your own scripts.

```javascript
// Example: Get your color swatch element
const mySwatch = document.querySelector('.my-swatch');

// Add a click listener to it
mySwatch.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Call the module's open method
    ColorPickerModule.open({
        // The original color that never changes
        originalColor: mySwatch.dataset.originalColor,
        // The color to start editing from
        currentColor: mySwatch.dataset.currentColor,
        // Optional: Set the language ('en' or 'zh')
        lang: 'en', 
        // A callback that receives the final color state upon confirmation
        onConfirm: (finalState) => {
            // finalState is an object: { h, s, l, a } (values 0-1)
            // Use it to update your UI
            console.log('New color selected:', finalState);
            // e.g., updateMySwatchUI(finalState);
        }
    });
});
```

## üìñ API

### `ColorPickerModule.open(config)`
Opens and initializes the color picker module.

**Parameters:**
`config` (Object): A configuration object with the following properties:

*   `originalColor` (String, **Required**): The base color, used for the "Original" preview and the "reset" action. Supported formats: `#RRGGBB`, `#RRGGBBAA`, `rgb()`, `rgba()`.
*   `currentColor` (String, **Required**): The color to start editing from. Same format support.
*   `onConfirm` (Function, **Required**): A callback function that receives the final `colorState` object upon confirmation (when clicking outside the picker). The `colorState` object is in the format `{ h, s, l, a }`, with all values normalized between `0` and `1`.
*   `lang` (String, *Optional*): Sets the UI language. Defaults to `'zh'`. Supported values: `'en'`, `'zh'`.

### `ColorPickerModule.setLocale(lang)`
Globally sets the language for all subsequent picker openings, if you prefer not to set it in each `open` call.
* `lang` (String): `'en'` or `'zh'`.
